# 🚀 My Journey to Becoming a Back-End Developer

Welcome! I'm **Fariez Fikhi**, and this is the start of my journey to becoming a **back-end developer**. After six years of pursuing opportunities outside the tech world, I’ve decided to return to what I’m truly passionate about—**technology** and **software development**.

## 🎓 A Bit About My Background
I hold a **Bachelor’s degree in Networking Systems** (2018) and an **MSc in Embedded System Design Engineering** (2020). Though I’ve been away from the IT field since 2020, my enthusiasm for technology has never wavered. Now, I’m back and ready to bring my knowledge up to date.

## 🛠️ Relearning and Growing
As I step back into the tech world, I’m focused on **relearning** and **rebuilding** the skills necessary for back-end development. While some of my expertise has become a bit rusty, I’m excited to reignite that knowledge and **master new technologies** that are shaping today’s industry.

## 📍 Staying Focused with a Roadmap
To make sure I stay on track, I’m following the guide from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/backend). This roadmap provides a structured path to back-end development, helping me focus on the **essential skills** without getting sidetracked by unrelated topics. By following this proven path, I aim to build a **strong, well-rounded foundation** in back-end development.

## 💻 Documenting My Progress
In this repository, I will document my journey from revisiting the basics to mastering advanced concepts. Expect to see:
- Practical projects and real-world applications
- Coding challenges and problem-solving exercises
- Continuous learning and application of back-end technologies

## 🚀 Join Me on This Exciting Path
I’m thrilled to be diving back into the world of technology and development. This journey represents my commitment to **continuous improvement** and my passion for creating robust, efficient back-end systems. 

Feel free to follow along as I **learn, grow, and build**. I’m excited to share my progress, challenges, and achievements with you!
